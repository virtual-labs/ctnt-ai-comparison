# Prompt 1

> I have given a screenshot of a simulation of mean and covariance simulator. I want it in a very modern dark interface
> using html, css and js. IT SHOULD BE RESPONSIVE.Use d3.js to maybe help you with visualisation.U have to implement all
> the functionalities in it. Feel free to write all the formulas needed for me. Incase of any questions ask to me at the
> end.
> DO NOT MISS ANY FEATURES

### Output can be seen at [Prompt 1](Claude_1.html)

# Prompt 2

> I have attached the code below.
Label what everything is properly. The input boxes are not responsive and is overflowing a lot. Adding custom points should be implemented for each class when I click on the graph after selecting a button to say if the point to be added is for class 1 or 2
add more features that you see fit and add at least one new feature

Problem here is that Claude ran out of the free message limit. So, I had to copy paste it to another chat and then do the prompting
This did not work since Claude reached maximum limit for me since I was in the free version
