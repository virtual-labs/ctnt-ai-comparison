# Based on Image to webpage

## Very Minimal Prompt

> Create a webpage for a edutech company. Use the image that I have provided
> for style inspirations

- The result for Claude can be seen [here](Claude_1.html)
- The result for Deepseek can be seen [here](Deepseek_1.html)

Though Deepseek and Claude gave pretty good webpages, one thing I notices is that Deepseek did not match the background
while Claude did it,
so I will give Claude the point.

## Building up on the previous task

> On the webpage you created, add a form that collects details of the users.
> I also need a very creative real life simulation that would help me with more view and attention rate

Here, I feel that Deepseek takes a lead. Claude just generated a very simple interaction of some notification popup
while Deepseek created a interactive learning path to show to the user.

# Describing Feature to make a fake simulation website

```
- I would like to teach about the plant anatomy.Create a very interactive website for my students that they can interact and learn from it.
- It should have at least one interactive diagram that helps the  students learn about the plant anatomy
- The website should also have a form that collects the details of the students queries
- The website should also have a very interactive quiz that the students can take to test their knowledge
- The website should have a results page that shows the students their scores and the correct answers
- Add at least one extra feature that you think is interesting
- I need all of this in a SINGLE HTML file. Always follow this one
```

  Here, Claude and Deepseek almost are very close with almost the same feature set

## Further Building It Up

### Deepseek

```
the plant visualization is not working. please correct it. Also, I could not understand the growth simulation part. Please explain that in the website what it does. 
also make it look sleek and modern
```

  Here, deepseek performed really well. It fixed all the images that where not rendering properly. I was very impressed
  with how the plant simulation works really well and how creative it is. But, I feel that it might have messed up the
  quiz part a little

### Claude
> Please fix the image of the visualization. It is not being rendered.Also, style it better to make it look modern and sleek

- The result for Claude can be seen [here](Claude_4.html)
Here, Claude did exceptionally well considering the fact that it does not have interest access at all. 
Here, it did not break up the quiz part, but the plant simulation is not working since the hover feature stopped working

# Uploading the Requirement Doc
> Read the PDF and make the website accordingly
- The PDF is the Detailed Requirement Doc given
- We just wanted to check how well first prompt can work
- The result for Claude can be seen [here](Claude_5.html)
- The result for Deepseek can be seen [here](Deepseek_5.html)
Here also, they came with a very similar result and thus we give equal points
# Verdict
- Overall, I feel that both are very evenly matched.
